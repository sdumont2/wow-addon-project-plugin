# WoW Add-on IntelliJ Plugin

### ***This Project is In Development and is not "public" yet***

This plugin is just meant to be a project generator that will help build the base structure of a World of Warcraft
addon project.

It is relatively dependent on the [EmmyLua](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9768-emmylua) intellij plugin to provide 
Lua language support.

It also relies on the advice and support from [this Ellypse repository wiki](https://github.com/Ellypse/IntelliJ-IDEA-Lua-IDE-WoW-API/wiki) 
and pulls resources from links within that wiki among other places.

## TODO

A Lot
